
Be aware of the following limitations of Remix trip-based GTFS:

agency.txt contains placeholder text not unique to your agency.

calendar.txt contains placeholder service IDs not unique to your agencyâ€™s
service periods.

calendar_dates.txt, an optional file containing service exceptions, is not
present.

routes.txt contains route_ids generated by Remix that may not match route_ids
in other software outputs.

Stops not enabled along lines in the related Remix map will not appear in
stops.txt or stop_times.txt.

stops.txt and trips.txt do not contain optional fields related to wheelchair or
bicycle accessibility.
