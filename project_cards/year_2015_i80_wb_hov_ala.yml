notes: Note to Gayathri:
  - county abbrevations: use ALA, CC, SC, SF, SM, NAP, SOL, SON, MAR
  - use ML_HOV as the place for TOLLCLASS (only relevant for bridges and express lanes, you can delete for HOV lanes)
  - for Ashish: how to code access/egress, can we use change: -1 to reduce a general purpose lane
